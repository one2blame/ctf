# BinEx101

In this challenge, `main()` stores the contents of the flag in a `struct`
called `s`. The `s` struct is of type `dynamic_strings` and it contains two
items, a `char*` called `flag` and an array of `char*`s called `numbers`.
The array of `char*`s contains an array of strings, with the strings counting
up to 9 as such: `"one"`, `"two"`, `"three"`, etc.

The goal of the challenge is to provide two positive integers that will be
multiplied and used to index into the `numbers` array. The two numbers are
saved into a variable of type `int`, this variable is signed while our integers
are unsigned. Using this, we can cause an interger overflow to occur, providing
us the ability to read into the `-1` index of `numbers` - an out-of-bounds
read. Doing this gives us the flag.

The value for the largest possible unsigned integer is UINT_MAX -
`4294967295`. Two nice factors of UINT_MAX are `65535` and `65537`, we use
these in `solve.py`.
